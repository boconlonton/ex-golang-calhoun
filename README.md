# Exercise 01: Quiz Game

## Part 1
- Create a program that will read in a quiz provided viz a CSV file and will then give the quiz to a user
keeping track of how many questions they get right and how many they get
incorrect. Regardless of whether the answer is correct or wrong the next question
should be asked immediately afterwards.

- The csv file should default to `problems.csv` but the user should be able
to customize the filename via a flag.
